 * This class is a child class of gGUIControl. Scrollable class provide scrollable
 * function on objects. When the box object's width and height is smaller than
 * it's content, developers can use this class.
 *
 * For using this class, firstly a set function must be wrote in the class that
 * used Scrollalble class. In this set function, set function must be called
 * from gGUIControl class. Secondly, setDimensions() function must be called
 * from Scrollable class. setDimensions() function updates some variables for
 * using draw window and scroll bars. Because of that parameters should be width
 * and height. Except for this two function, developers can call any function
 * which should be setted when added object to panel.
 *
 * After written set function, enableScrollbars function must be called. This
 * function makes scroll bars visible. For using scrollable function at least one
 * of the parameters must be active.
 *
 * If a class is generated from Scrollable class with inheritance, new class must
 * overrided drawContent() function.
