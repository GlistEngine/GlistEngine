/**
 * To use this class, simply add the instance of this class to your
 * Canvas's header file by: "gPostProcessManager ppm;". Then in your setup,
 * first call setDimensions to specify the area of which you want your
 * post-processing to happen. (Remember that currently it is only possible to
 * post-process on the center of the screen. So it's recommended that you
 * specify the width and height as your game's original width and height.)
 *
 * Then, to add post-process effects to your manager, call addEffect(). As a
 * parameter, you can use one of the default post-process effects that comes
 * with the engine. Such as; gBlur, gGrayscale, gInversion etc. To actually
 * add the effect, you can call the function with: "ppm.addEffect(new gBlur())"
 * You can change the "new gBlur()" part with any post-process that you like.
 * To use the effect, of course you have to include it first.
 *
 * After setting the dimensions and adding your effects inside the setup (or
 * any relevant work-once function), you can then use enable() function before
 * the draw call of an object that's going to get affected by the post-process
 * effect. After the draw calls of the ones that needs to get affected by post-
 * process effects, simply call disable().
