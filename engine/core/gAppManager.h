 *
 * gAppManager is synchronous. Thus, keeps getting updated every frame by engine
 * and keeps track of changes and inputs. Keeping track of current canvas,
 * getting user inputs, tracking elapsed time are some features of gAppManager.
 *
 * All the inputs of user is received instantly by methods of this class. This
 * updating process continues until the app is closed.
 *
 * gAppManager also handles synchronous draw function. If the canvas is not empty,
 * drawing process continues until the app is closed.
 *
 * Developers should be careful when working with this class. Any wrong input can
 * cause a huge difference in the app. Double checking the gStartEngine function
 * before doing anything else is recommended.
 *
 * Methods of this class should not be called directly from anywhere else, this may
 * cause unexpected errors, excluding gStartEngine, which is a free function
